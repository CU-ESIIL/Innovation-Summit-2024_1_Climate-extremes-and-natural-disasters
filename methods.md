# Methods
Compare and combine digital elevation model (DEM), social vulnerability index (SVI), and CMIP5 precipitation projections to evaluate disproportionate risk to precipitation anomalies along population demographic.

## Social vulnerability index (SVI) 
SVI is a metric created by the CDC using US Census data to help local officials "identify communities that may need support before, during, or after disasters" ([CDC](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html) )

**Social Vulnerability:** The degree to which communities are susceptible to external factors such as epidemics and natural disasters.
