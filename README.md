# Evaluating extreme flood risk and disproportionate vulnerability in 5 hours ðŸŒŠ


## Research Question
How can we combine open datasets and ML to improve extreme flood prediction and flood vulnerability in Houston, Texas?

## Objectives 

1. Evaluating and synthesizing current precipitation flood risk predictions
1. Assessing the spatial correlation between flood predictions and social vulnerability. 
1. Identifying regions indicating a compounded risk for flood hazard.
